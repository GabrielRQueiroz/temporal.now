## About

This is a kind of a simple and a sketchy "cheatsheet" for some basic Temporal API useful functionalities.
Notice that it is **NOT** meant to be helpful to everyone, especially when there already exists an official documentation for it.
This tiny project is just a way I found of practicing and understandind this new js feature, but feel free to take a look. ðŸ˜€
